<p markdown="1">Revuo is an independent newsletter: domain & hosting expenses are covered with the help of readers. Editorial time spent accumulating resources and news is solely volunteered by yours truly, <a href="https://rottenwheel.com/" target="_blank">rottenwheel</a>.</br></br>
    Thus far it has not allocated funding through <a href="https://ccs.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero's CCS</a>, secured a sponsorship agreement with a third party, or kicked up its own <a href="https://github.com/rottenstonks/flipstarter-waas-wip" target="_blank">self-hosted wishlist</a> campaign.</br></br>
    If you get value out of Revuo Monero and wish to see it continue, you can send some XMR to this subaddress:</p>
