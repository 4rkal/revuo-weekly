<p markdown="1">Revuo is an independent newsletter: domain & hosting expenses are covered with help of generous donors. Editorial time to accumulate resources and news is solely volunteered by yours truly, rottenwheel. It has not allocated funding through Monero's CCS, secured a sponsorship agreement with a third party, or ran its own self-hosted wishlist campaign.
    If you get any value out of Revuo Monero and want to keep it thriving, you can send some XMR to this subaddress:</p>
